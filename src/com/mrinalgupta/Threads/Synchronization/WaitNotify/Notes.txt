Monitors -
    -A monitor is something a thread can grab and hold,
     preventing all other threads from grabbing that same monitor
     and forcing them to wait until the monitor is released.
     This is what a synchronized block does.

    - they provide object based locking and unlocking
    - In case of synchronized methods, lock is associated with the object whose method is being called.
